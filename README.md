# Homestretch-Hackathon
Procedures for the Oct 7-9 Hackathon at SF HQ

To make the most of our time together, please follow these procedures.  Many of you reading this already have access to the tools we use, so this is a refresher that will help you on-board new members at the event.

Prior to the Hackathon, please join our groups:

1. Sign up to be a DevProgress member, and follow the onboarding procedures including Code of Conduct, Acceptable Licenses, and Contributor Agreement.  Get started here:  https://devprogress.us/
2. Setup access to DevProgress in Slack, GitHub, and Trello
3. Join #local-san-francisco and #team-hackathon on Slack
4. Review GitHub and Trello to see what we're working on to better understand the ideas that are out there and where you can add value
5. For existing project leaders, update your GitHub Issues and Trello so that people know what you need; also we may be bandwidth challenged so please plan to download local copies of things that you may need

Come to the hackathon ready to pitch your idea, vote, and join a team.  We want to build and ship as much as possible, so we will move quickly through the idea generation and team forming phases.
